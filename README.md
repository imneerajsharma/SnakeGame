# SnakeGame
Snake Game: A classic Java implementation where players control a snake navigating a grid, eating food to grow, while avoiding collisions with walls and itself.

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Java. The game provides a graphical interface where the player controls a snake that moves around a board, eating food to grow longer. The objective is to survive as long as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake itself.

## Features:
Graphical Interface: The game provides a graphical user interface using Java's Swing library.
Dynamic Snake: The snake grows longer as it eats food and moves around the board.
Random Food Placement: Food items are randomly generated on the board, providing a new challenge each time.
Random Snake Head Placement: The initial position of the snake head is randomly generated within a certain range from the center of the board, adding variability to the game start.
Grid Display: The game board is displayed as a grid, making it easy for the player to navigate.

## How to Play:
Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
The snake will continuously move in the direction it's facing.
Eat food items to grow longer.
Avoid running into the walls or colliding with the snake itself.

## Development:
This project was developed using Java and utilizes object-oriented programming principles. It provides a simple example of game development and graphical user interface programming in Java.

## Getting Started:
To run the game locally, make sure you have Java installed on your system. Clone this repository and compile and run the SnakeGame.java file. Enjoy playing the Snake Game!

## Future Improvements:
Implement game-over conditions such as collision detection.
Add a scoring system and high-score tracking.
Improve graphics and user interface design.
